#SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SEQUENTIAL LOGIC CIRCUITS

AIM : To simulate and synthesis SR, JK, T, D - FLIPFLOP, COUNTER DESIGN using Vivado 2023.2.

APPARATUS REQUIRED : Vivado™ ML 2023.2

PROCEDURE:

Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.

PROCEDURE:
STEP:1  Start  the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2  Select the device family, device, package and speed.       
STEP:3  Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.                       
STEP:4  Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.
STEP:5  Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.                       
STEP:6  Click the simulation to simulate the program and  give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.               
STEP:7  Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window.
STEP:8  Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize  XST Process. Double Click in the  FloorplanArea/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 
STEP:9  In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu.
STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here.
STEP:11  On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
